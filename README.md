# ❎'s and 🅾's

This is a small 🐍 Python project written during my off-time as a peer tutor at Jefferson High School. 

This project is based off of the major Python project students are concluded with in the **Exploring Computer Science** course.

This project introduces students towards the experience of writing their very first standalone program: 
> a game of "Tic-tac-toe" / "noughts and crosses" written in the Pygame library.

This version of the program deviates from the original functionality, being developed differently to work object-orientated, therefore it has no resembalance with the originally expected end-product. This is just my personal take on the assignment.
